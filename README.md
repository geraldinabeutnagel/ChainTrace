# ChainTrace

A blockchain-based supply chain traceability platform leveraging decentralized storage, IoT data integration, and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Overview

ChainTrace is designed to provide transparent, secure, and verifiable supply chain tracking from production to consumption. The platform enables manufacturers, logistics providers, retailers, and consumers to participate in a decentralized supply chain ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-based Traceability**: Complete product lifecycle tracking on-chain
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time sensor data collection and verification
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving data verification
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS integration for scalable data storage
- **Multi-party Collaboration**: DID-based identity management and access control
- **API & SDK**: Standardized interfaces for enterprise integration

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contracts**: TraceRegistry, ProofVerifier, AccessControl, AuditLog
2. **Frontend**: React-based web application for supply chain visualization
3. **Backend**: Node.js API server with blockchain integration
4. **IoT Module**: Edge computing nodes for sensor data processing
5. **Storage Layer**: IPFS for decentralized data storage

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric / Polygon / Arbitrum
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Web3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Storage**: IPFS
- **Cryptography**: zk-SNARKs, Post-quantum cryptography

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Basic blockchain traceability and smart contracts
- **Phase 2**: IoT device integration and real-time tracking
- **Phase 3**: Zero-knowledge proofs and privacy protection
- **Phase 4**: Open API, SDK, and enterprise integration
